    <h2>About EqualBangla</h2>
    <p><strong>EqualBangla</strong> is a project created to collect vital information about the victims of state-led violence during the July-August 2024 Movement in Bangladesh. We aim to honor the victims and expose the injustices they faced. Our goal is to create a detailed record of the injured, missing, and deceased individuals so that future generations can remember the struggle for equality and justice.</p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>Our mission is to create a platform that encourages citizens to share the stories of those affected by this oppression. We believe that by documenting these events, we can help bring about justice and ensure that these atrocities are not forgotten.</p>

    <h3>How the Data Will Be Used</h3>
    <p>The data collected will be used solely for research, documentation, and justice purposes. We will ensure that all personal information is kept secure and used responsibly. The goal is to create a comprehensive record of what happened during the movement, so the world can know the truth and help prevent future tragedies.</p>
