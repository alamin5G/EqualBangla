            <h2>About Equal Bangladesh</h2>
            <p><strong>Equal Bangladesh</strong> is a project created to collect vital information about the victims of
                state-led violence during the July-August 2024 Movement in Bangladesh. We aim to honor the victims and
                expose the injustices they faced. Our goal is to create a detailed record of the injured, missing, and
                deceased individuals so that future generations can remember the struggle for equality and justice.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to create a platform that encourages citizens to share the stories of those affected by
                this oppression. We believe that by documenting these events, we can help bring about justice and ensure
                that these atrocities are not forgotten.</p>

            <h3>How the Data Will Be Used</h3>
            <p>The data collected will be used solely for research, documentation, and justice purposes. We will ensure
                that all personal information is kept secure and used responsibly. The goal is to create a comprehensive
                record of what happened during the movement, so the world can know the truth and help prevent future
                tragedies.</p>
