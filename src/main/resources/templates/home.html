            <h2>About the July-August Movement</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2024, hundreds of students and protesters in Bangladesh were subjected to violence and
                persecution by the regime of Sheikh Hasina. The anti-discrimination movement aimed to bring attention to
                widespread government oppression. However, this peaceful movement was met with brutality, resulting in
                the deaths of many young lives.</p>
            <h3>Why We Collect Data</h3>
            <p>This project, <strong>Equal Bangladesh</strong>, seeks to collect, document, and preserve the stories and
                facts surrounding the tragic events of July-August 2024. By gathering this data, we aim to give a voice
                to the victims and hold those responsible for atrocities accountable. The collected data will serve as a
                historical record of the events and help in future justice-seeking efforts.</p>
            <h3>How This Project Works</h3>
            <p>We collect victim information through verified submissions. After a user verifies their email address,
                they are allowed to submit details related to the victimsâ€”whether injured, missing, or dead. Each
                submission will be stored in a secure database, reviewed for accuracy, and kept confidential.</p>
